Time Is Money
===

If you've ever been stuck in a meeting with too many people that drags on for far too long, you know how much of a time waster meetings frequently turn into. They suck up time and energy and prevent real work from getting done, and people either forget or are ignorant of how expensive this becomes.

Time Is Money is an easy-to-use app that keeps a running tally of exactly how expensive those dragging meetings are, in dollar terms.
